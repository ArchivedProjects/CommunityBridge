  # This is where we specify how to associate a Minecraft player with a web
  # application user. We do this by matching up the player name with a name
  # stored in the web application's database.
  #
  # If you want your players to use the same name on both the server and the
  # web application, then you will need to provide the table and column
  # information where the web application relates its user IDs with the user's
  # name/login ID/login/username.
  #
  # If you want to allow them to use a different name on the web application,
  # you need to add a custom field or column to your web application's database,
  # and provide that table and column information here.

  # The name of the table which contains the columns:
  table-name:

  # Column on the table that contains the user ID. Typically something like
  # user_id or member_id
  user-id-column:

  # If the player name is stored in a key-value pair of columns instead of
  # its own column, set this to true:
  uses-key: false

  # If you set 'linking-uses-key' to false, then set this to the column that
  # the playername is stored in. Otherwise, leave it empty.
  playername-column:

  # If you set 'linking-uses-key' to true, then set the key column, value column,
  # and the key-name here. Otherwise, leave these fields empty.
